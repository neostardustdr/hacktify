When an application does not properly handle user supplied data, an attacker can supply valid HTML code, typically via a parameter value, and inject their own content into the page. It is generally exploited using social engineering in order to trick valid users of the application to open malicious websites or to insert the credentials in a fake login form that will redirect the users to a page that captures cookies or credentials
